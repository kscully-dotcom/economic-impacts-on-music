<h2>Data</h2>
<p>The Billboard Hot 100 lists the top trending songs each week. After running into several issues with scraping the Spotify website and the overall tax on my small machine, that data was outsourced. For this paper, Sean Miller gathered data from the Billboard Hot 100 from 1958 to 2021. He has gathered the Hot 100 songs and a dataset with the song features from Spotify's API.</p>
